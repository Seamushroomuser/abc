                <p class="text-muted text-left">Definitely in my favourite malls in Hyderabad. Beautifully located in the midst of the largest tech company infrastructures around, and a pretty bridge with a lake below it, it's got to take the cake. I went to this mall to visit H and M and to grab something to drink (Photos attached with the review). It has a multitude of choices when it comes to food outlets and stores. You can literally spend hours over here, and then combine it with your IKEA visit which is not too far from this location. A must visit place in Hyderabad, since there's nothing much to do in the city apart from these few things.</p>

            <p>Saw it today i loved it.You should have a minimal previous understanding of the movies or youâ€™ll miss 40% of the fun.At minimum:Infinity WarCivil WarBlack PantherAge ofAnt Man and the WaspProblem is that the whole movie is homage to all movies. Yet you will enjoy it a lot.There is at the beginning of the movie a (spoiler alert) head dismemberment that is quite impressive. But most is comic book style figand battles.Must go to bathroom just before the movie because ut does last 3 hours all worthwhile.</p>

            <p>*Shakuntala Devi ,more of a mother than mathematician! A must see*
                All of us know the genius mathematician Shakuntaladevi also known as *human* *computer,* but we dont know much about the person and mother in her.This movie depicts this beautifully in an entertaining and hilarious way and makes the ( so called) boring subject of mathematics very interesting!
                Good news is gorgeously charming and versatile Vidya Balan is back to her magic again in this biopic movie.
                This Family Light Comic Biopic Certainly takes You into the world of the super genius and the super Intellectual Shakuntala Devi in the most entertaining way and with her way of dealing her life in an enthusiastically stressfree manner , yet this movie indirectly has a lot more to offer its audience ; In terms of The Sacrifices The Mothers make, and just in case some of them let their dreams fulfilled , they are so easily reprimanded of their title of Motherhood !
                This movie very beautifully answers this dilemma with the climax !
                Also the Comic timing , the humor , the jolly light moments leave us with more cravings for her!
                And esp., the relationship between Mothers and Daughters is so beautifully showcased , that you just can't miss out on this flick !
                Thank you to the content makers for bringing into light to this generation the HUMAN COMPUTER, the pride of India in Mathematics , SHAKUNTALA DEVI !!!
                I BET noone would have played her Better than the gorgeously charming and versatile Vidya Balan
